A place where phone engineers can share their knowledge with each other. There are so many little tips and tricks that are very case specific, that it's good to have a place where it's first of all EASY to share stuff that only experience with these intricate devices can give.

There is lot of information online that does not come from the experienced fellows but it's mostly guessing etc. So here we have REAL information that is tested.

I used react + tailwind setup in this pretty simple frontend. The database will utilize mongo atlas.

Simple log-in page:

No fluff frontpage. Contributors get some glory ofc:

Easy submission. Straight to the point:

Manual check is done for each submission to prevent weird stuff.
